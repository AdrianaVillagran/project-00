# Racing Game

* **Objective:** Make a racing game where two players can race across the DOM by holding down a specific key.*

## Technologies Used

* Handlebars
* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript (Mainly Object Constructor Functions)


## Existing Features

* Players press a specific key to move right toward the end of the track.
* When one of the players gets to the finish, an alert pops up to announce the winner.
* Players can reset the track to start a new race.
* Each time the track is reset the number of wins per player is tracked on each car.

## Planned Features

* A much more exciting winning sequence
